# MAIL

## MAIL TEMPLATES
Thoughtful integration of emails can be an effective means of notifying and engaging your members. Other than the initial thank you email, all other emails should be `opt in` and should include an `unsubscribe link`. 

These tools are helpful in designing mail templates:

## REMOVING MAIL FUNCTIONALITY
If you decide you would rather not have a mail service as part of your administrative IoT application, you must do the following:

  1) In `mail.js`, comment out lines 3, 5-16
  2) In `socket.js`, comment out line 26
